How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

SCRUM methodology allows for more flexibility in development than traditional waterfall practices. By creating user stories specific to the project, it allows developers to tackle specific items based off of importance. It also gives a measure of tasks completed in a given timeframe (sprint) which can be provided to boardmembers/investors for feedback. Since agile is constantly adapting these requirements and stories can change but the development team also is set up to succeed in this enviornment.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have really gained a better idea of managing larger assignments with agile practices. Breaking larger projects into sections and working until completion helps manage the requirements of a project. There is also unit testing created alongside the codebase and being able to test sections upon completion helps iron out issues that could arise in development. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
 It is crucial to be a team player in software development. There are instances of cross-integration within the team, when some members may have a different skillset than others. Team members can also have priorities shifted as the project does. It is important to have the ability to pivot tasks during developemnt and learning new skills to help utilize the potential involvment you can have within the team.
